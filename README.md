# Neural Trees for Multiple Instance Learning

Assignment project for Computer Vision course, UJ 2021/22

The idea is to implement MIForests from

`https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15567-3_3.pdf`

using "neuralized" trees, as in

`https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2015/papers/Kontschieder_Deep_Neural_Decision_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf`

and test it on datasets from
